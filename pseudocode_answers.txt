1.) Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	
	--Programmers use pseudocode as an outline prior to beginning to code.  As someone who has studied several foreign languages, I view it as creating a rough draft prior to 'translating' it to my language of choice.

2.) If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

	--If I were to attempt to run psuedocode on my computer, it would error out; it's not a language that the computer would understand.



Pseudocode Algorithms

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greatest number.

	INPUT first number
	INPUT second number

	IF first number is greater than second number, return first number
	  ELSE IF first number is less than second number, return second number
	  ELSE IF first number equals second number, return 'Numbers are equal.'
	  ELSE return null
	END

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

	INIT total to 0
	WHILE the number is less than 100
		ADD 1 to total
	RETURN total
	END

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

	LET entry equal i
	SET variable equal to Tricia
	  WHILE i is not equal to Tricia, get next entry.
	ENDWHILE;

function phone (array) {
	for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
	  if (array[i] == "Tricia") {
	    console.log array[i]} 
	}
}
